      <p>This isn't actually a picture of me, though I do in some respects favor the cryptid known as Bigfoot. I am not hairy, nor am I particularly large footed however I do tend to walk on two feet as this creature is purported to do. I am apt to roam the woods when the occasion calls for it. I am fond of trees and other greenish brown plants. Am I Bigfoot? Perhaps we will never know. For now, Will is just fine. Thanks for stopping by.
